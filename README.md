# Bookstore Database Project

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a relational MySQL database for a bookstore. The goal is to efficiently store and manage data about books, authors, customers, orders, shipping methods, and more. By completing this project, we aim to demonstrate practical skills in database design, SQL programming, and user management.



## Tools and Technologies
- **MySQL**: For building and managing the database.
- **Draw.io**: For creating and visualizing the database schema.


## Objectives
- Design and implement a MySQL database for a bookstore.
- Create efficient table schemas and relationships for the dataset.
- Manage database access with user groups and roles to ensure security.
- Test the database by running meaningful queries to retrieve and analyze data.



## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional MySQL database for the bookstore use case.
- Well-defined tables with appropriate schema and data types.
- Effective user access control using roles and permissions.
- Demonstration of querying capabilities to extract valuable insights.
